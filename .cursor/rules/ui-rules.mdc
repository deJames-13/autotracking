Enforce responsive design principles (mobile-first, fluid layouts).

Adopt a component-based architecture:

Use reusable UI components.

Isolate logic and styles in each component.

Implement a file-based structure:

Each component gets its own folder (e.g., Button/, Navbar/, Card/).

Folder includes: index.tsx, styles.module.css, config.ts (if needed).

Enable easy configuration via:

Global and local config files (e.g., ui.config.json).

Theme and variant support through configuration.

Integrate design tokens or utility-first CSS (like TailwindCSS).

Encourage dynamic imports and lazy loading to improve performance.

Set up linting rules and pre-commit hooks to enforce structure.
