# Equipment Table Archive/Delete Refresh Fix

## Issue
The equipment table was not refreshing after archive/delete operations, leaving stale data visible to users.

## Root Cause Analysis
The equipment page uses a different data fetching strategy compared to other admin pages:

### Other Admin Pages (like Locations)
- Use Inertia.js props for data
- Refresh using `router.reload({ only: ['locations'] })`
- Data is managed by Laravel and passed as props

### Equipment Page  
- Uses AJAX calls with `axios` for data fetching
- Data is managed in React state via `fetchEquipment()` function
- Props refresh doesn't work because data isn't from Inertia props

## Solution Implemented

### Before (Incorrect)
```tsx
const handleEditSuccess = () => {
    setEditingEquipment(null);
    router.reload({ only: ['equipment'] }); // ❌ Doesn't work - no 'equipment' prop
};

const handleDeleteSuccess = () => {
    setDeletingEquipment(null);
    router.reload({ only: ['equipment'] }); // ❌ Doesn't work - no 'equipment' prop
};
```

### After (Correct)
```tsx
const handleEditSuccess = () => {
    setEditingEquipment(null);
    onRefresh?.(); // ✅ Calls parent's refreshEquipment function
};

const handleDeleteSuccess = () => {
    setDeletingEquipment(null);
    onRefresh?.(); // ✅ Calls parent's refreshEquipment function
};
```

## Data Flow

### Equipment Index Page (`/admin/equipment/index.tsx`)
1. **State Management**: Manages equipment data in React state
2. **Data Fetching**: Uses `fetchEquipment()` function with AJAX calls
3. **Refresh Function**: Provides `refreshEquipment()` callback to table
```tsx
const refreshEquipment = useCallback(() => {
    fetchEquipment({ ...filters });
}, [filters]);
```

### Equipment Table Component
1. **Receives Callback**: Gets `onRefresh` prop from parent
2. **Success Handlers**: Call `onRefresh?.()` instead of router reload
3. **Data Update**: Parent re-fetches data and updates table

## Comparison with Other Pages

| Feature | Locations Page | Equipment Page |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Data Source** | Inertia props | AJAX state |
| **Refresh Method** | `router.reload()` | `onRefresh()` callback |
| **State Management** | Laravel/Inertia | React useState |
| **Benefits** | Simpler setup | More flexible filtering |

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `equipment-table.tsx` - Updated success handlers to use `onRefresh` callback

### Files Supporting This Fix
- `equipment/index.tsx` - Provides `refreshEquipment` function
- `equipment-delete-dialog.tsx` - Already correctly calls `onSuccess`
- `equipment-edit-dialog.tsx` - Already correctly calls `onSuccess`

## Testing Verified

### Manual Testing Steps
1. ✅ Open equipment management page
2. ✅ Archive an equipment record
3. ✅ Verify table immediately updates (removed from list)
4. ✅ Edit an equipment record
5. ✅ Verify table immediately shows updated data
6. ✅ Create new equipment record
7. ✅ Verify table immediately shows new record

### Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Frontend build successful
- ✅ No console errors

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see changes instantly
2. **Better UX**: No manual page refresh needed
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Matches user expectations
4. **Data Accuracy**: Table always shows current state

## Future Considerations

### Option 1: Migrate to Inertia Props (Recommended)
- Move equipment data fetching to Laravel controller
- Use Inertia props like other admin pages
- Simplify refresh logic

### Option 2: Keep Current Architecture
- Current fix works perfectly
- More flexible for complex filtering
- Good for real-time updates
