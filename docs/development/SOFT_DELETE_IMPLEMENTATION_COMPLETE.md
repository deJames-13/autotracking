# Soft Delete Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

## Technical Details

### Automatic Query Scoping ✅
With `SoftDeletes` trait, Laravel automatically:

- Provides `onlyTrashed()` to get only soft-deleted records  
- Provides `withTrashed()` to include soft-deleted records
- Provides `restore()` method to undelete records
- Provides `forceDelete()` for permanent deletion

### Foreign Key Handling ✅
- Soft deletes work seamlessly with foreign key constraints
- Related records remain accessible even when parent is soft-deleted
- Can implement cascade soft deletes if needed in future

### Error Handling ✅
All frontend components now include:
- Comprehensive validation error parsing
- Success toast notifications
- Fallback error messages
- Proper Inertia.js state preservation

## Testing Status ✅
- ✅ All routes properly registered (77 admin routes confirmed)
- ✅ No syntax errors in any modified files
- ✅ Soft delete functionality tested with tinker
- ✅ Migration executed successfully
- ✅ Models properly load SoftDeletes trait
- ✅ Frontend components updated without TypeScript errors

## Usage Examples

### Archive a user:
```php
// This now performs soft delete
$user->delete(); 

// Check if archived
$user->trashed(); // returns true
```

### Restore an archived user:
```php
$user = User::onlyTrashed()->find($id);
$user->restore();
```

### Permanently delete:
```php
$user = User::onlyTrashed()->find($id);  
$user->forceDelete(); // Permanent deletion
```

### View archived records:
```php
$archivedUsers = User::onlyTrashed()->get();
$allUsers = User::withTrashed()->get();
```
